Also text language can be very confusing and some people may not be able to understand a message e.g. “hey il brb r u in 2day” which means “hey I will be right back, are you in today?”

Listening to music on the go can have a negative effect because if someone is listening to music on their bike it might make it more relaxing to ride but it cuts you off from what is happening around you so you might not hear the siren of an emergency vehicle, or another road user sounding their horn as a warning and even traffic noise that would warn you that buses or lorries were near you.

Looking at pictures is negative because it can distract people walking on the pavement and if they suddenly walk into the road they could cause an accident. https://www.gcit.edu.bt/ <br></br><br></br>

Taking pictures/videos could be negative because someone could use them in activities such as crime and/ or violence related (e.g. happy slaps).

Making a video call can be negative because it can be used anywhere which can distract people especially if it’s in a public place which is very busy e.g. Oxford street.

The negative aspects of making phone calls is because it costs too much to make one phone call from one country to another country e.g. England to Australia would normally cost 50p upward for one minute and even to receive a phone call when you are abroad costs you money.</string>
